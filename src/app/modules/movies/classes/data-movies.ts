    'opening_crawl': 'Fans of Benedict Cumberbatch, the thinking person’s sex symbol, adds another great performance to a canon that includes his remarkable Sherlock Holmes, by inhabiting the life of Alan Turing, the brilliant mathematician who helped usher in the computer age by breaking the German Enigma Code, thereby helping the Allies bring WWII to a faster conclusion. Count on another Oscar nomination for Cumberbatch for Best actor. Turing was gay, a crime in Great Britain until 1967, and director Morten Tyldum, handles that aspect of the story with a delicate touch until a heartbreaking final few scenes involving his prosecution by the country he secretly helped save. A great British cast, including Matthew Goode, Mark Strong, Charles Dance and especially Keira Knightley, who gives her strongest performance to date, give the drama it’s heft.',
